This assignment I think I am able to better understand a little bit about what you wanted. Looking at the specific methods I see that there are easier/cleaner ways I could have gone about doing the assignment. For example, the CompareTo method yours was very simple and straightforward and mine was not. It is methods like those where I need to do more studying and practice how to make my code more clean instead of messy and kind of all over the place. That is something for future assignments I will work on. It is very helpful on the other hand to see your answers to each part and an explanation on why you did what you did. Thank you.
