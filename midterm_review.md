As someone who has done java before I haven't taken a class on it in a few years and just getting back into the swing of things. So far I would say that I have managed okay. At first I was very confused but I am beginning to understand concepts and lessons better than when I first started. I have been learning from my mistakes in class and have learned my mistakes from previous assignments that I may have not done correctly either because I didn't understand it properly or because I did not give myself enough time. I am definitely going to get better with that in the second part of the course. Although not all my code has worked perfectly they do have comments on what the thought process was and I did have an assignment that did not compile but that was my fault.  I will say I don't really like javadoc because I like to comment everything out but I see it is something you are looking for and will make sure to implement that for future assignments. I do show up to class. I've missed I believe 2 or 3 days due to  some work conflicts but I have engaged and answered questions in class and do my best to follow along. I am committed and take initiative, I watch tutorials and read the effective java book that you suggested for java users in general. I do need to be better with reaching out to you if I'm confused about a certain question and will do better to do that. I have also made it a point to follow the Programmers Pact as well as I uploaded the signed version to my repository.
